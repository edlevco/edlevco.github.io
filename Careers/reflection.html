        In Grade 10 I was introduced to the class Career Studies where I learned a lot of useful information which will help me in the future. If I had to choose from every task in this class, I believe that making a cover letter and resume has helped me the most in my work life. This year I have started looking for a job as a swim instructor since I have recently received my NLS and Instructors. However, when I emailed a swim place I quickly realized that they needed a resume. I was so clueless that I had to search it up and while making it I didn’t know information to add and what to keep to myself. Luckily, to my surprise we started learning how to make a resume in my Careers studies class. I learned so much about what is a resume, how to format it, what information to add, and how to construct a cover letter. Not only will this be extremely useful when I need to make a new resume for other jobs, but I actually used it to get a job at Davina's Swim School. Even though the resume building was the most useful, I would have to say that the ISA was the most interesting Assignment I’ve ever done in highschool so far. I think I found the ISA so interesting because it was researching a job of my liking rather than something I had no interest in. I was so intrigued to learn about life as a software engineer as I have a small passion for programming and creating applications. I learned about different types of software engineers, what they do, and how they are so beneficial to the world we live in. I would say that this assignment boosted my interest in the job and persuaded my to work as a software engineer. After my interview, Turja was kind enough to enhance my programming skills. He helped me understand libraries and github which helped me make this website. To summarize, I love my Careers class and have found it super interesting and useful to building my future career.
